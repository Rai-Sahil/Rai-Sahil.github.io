  abstract={CNNs are widely used in a variety of computer vision tasks such as image processing, image classification, etc. The state-of-the-art neural networks are bigger and have greater number of parameters which translates to greater computations and memory footprint. This makes it difficult to deploy the real-time applications using these models on resource constrained edge devices. To address this issue, pruning techniques have been explored which reduce the number of computations and memory requirements of modern CNNs with negligible loss in accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the performance of three different pruning techniques - L1-norm based filter pruning, channel pruning and weight pruning and compare the performance in terms of inference time and accuracy. We also compared the performance of the pruned networks on two different GPU architectures and found that the inference time of pruned networks is more boosted in NVIDIA V100 compared to NVIDIA GTX1080 Ti due to its superior architecture features. We also perform inference speedup comparison between the different pruning techniques and analyze performance benefits between the different pruning techniques.},
